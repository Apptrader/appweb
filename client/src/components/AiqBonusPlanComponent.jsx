          <h2 className='text-blue-400 text-2xl'>ENROLLMENT LEG RANK REQUIREMENT:</h2>
          <p className='py-2 px-3'>A distributor will have enrollment leg rank requirements as they advance in the Bonus Plan. This requirement is calculated by the highest rank achieved(during a commission period) by any distributor in each of your enrollment legs. For example, if one of your enrollment legs is considered an InternationalExecutive leg, this means your personal enrollment, or someone in that enrollment leg, has reached the rank of Global Executive.</p>

          <h2 className='text-blue-400 text-2xl'>HOLDING VOLUME:</h2>
          <p className='py-2 px-3'>Holding volume is volume not included in commission calculation on the strong leg AFTER team commissions are calculated for a given commission period. This volume “holds”, or is accumulated for use in future commissionperiods. Holding volume always remains on the leg it originates from. For all future commission periods, the holding volume is added to the total volume generated on that side during that commission period. *Please note, the holding volume will be removed 60 days after a distributor falls inactive.</p>
