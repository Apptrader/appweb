          <p className='py-2 px-3'>A distributor will have enrollment leg rank requirements as they advance in the Bonus Plan. This requirement is calculated by the highest rank achieved(during a commission period) by any distributor in each of your enrollment legs.

          <p className='py-2 px-3'>Holding volume is volume not included in commission calculation on the strong leg AFTER team commissions are calculated for a given commission period. This volume “holds”, or is accumulated for use in future commissionperiods. Holding volume always remains on the leg it originates from.
